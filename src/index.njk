A little bit about me,
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to starting my academic journey of pursuing a BS in Computer Science, I had a robust career as a 
<a id="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu">Jiu-Jitsu</a>
 professional. I spent over a decade (from the age of 10 - 24) studying Jiu-Jitsu specific body mechanics and strategy. I was able to reach the pinnacle level of Jiu-Jitsu competition and pride myself on being a formidable competitor. Towards the end of my competition career I authored many technical documents on the subject and began teaching and leading teams. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Nowdays, I apply that same relentless energy and passion on the research and practice of technology (sometimes I still write about jiu-jitsu). I am currently enrolled in PSU under their engineering program. I love coding in C++ though I don‚Äôt discriminate, I love any framework/language that‚Äôs going to do the job for my use case.
